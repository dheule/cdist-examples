This type is used to create a script on hosts to unlock
a crypted device and mount at a specific location.

Use case:

    Services are running on remote hosts, to which other parties
    in a datacenter may have access to. To prevent them from accessing
    the data, the hosts start and later on the data partition
    is manually unlocked.
