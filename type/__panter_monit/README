This type allows you to configure monit (http://mmonit.com/monit/).
It contains some examples for services used together with
Ruby on Rails (aka rails, http://rubyonrails.org/).

Configuration snippets for monit are stored in files/config/.

Use case:

    Whenever you need to ensure something runs even if it crashes.

Special Use Case:

    There is a more special configuation file available, namely
    developer-monit. As you can see in files/config/developer-monit,
    it checks for a monit configuration file within the home directory
    of the rails user.

    This allows (rails) developers to include their own 
    monit configurations to ensure programs required by the rails
    website are up and running.

Example use:

    __panter_monit dj
    __panter_monit developer-monit
