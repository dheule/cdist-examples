This type is being used at local.ch to setup the CentOS based
VM hosts running qemu-kvm. It supports device bonding via LACP
and VMs are connect to two different networks (presentation and storage
network) using VLAN tags on the host.

The VMs are started using generated shell scripts and backgrounded using
screen.

This type works together with __localch_kvm_vm.

The explorer interface_style is used to detect whether the interface
naming scheme is traditional (ethX) or location based (p6p2).

Supporting executables:

    - files/bin/ifdown: Called when the VM is being shutdown
    - files/bin/ifup-fz:
    - files/bin/ifup-pz:
        Both called when the storage or presentation interface is setup
        -> adjusts the mtu to 9000
        -> interface is added to the correct host bridge
    - files/bin/remove-vm: Removes a VM
    - files/bin/stop-vm: Stops a VM
    - files/init.d/kvm-vms: Init script to start VMs

Supporting configuration:

    - files/iptables: ensure the firewall is off on the host (it's the VMs task)
    - files/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond0: Setup the LACP device
    - files/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond0.2: VLAN tag over LACP for presentation network
    - files/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond0.3: VLAN tag over LACP for storage network
    - files/network-scripts/ifcfg-brfz: Bridge that contains VM storage network interfaces
    - files/network-scripts/ifcfg-brpz: Bridge that contains VM presentation network interfaces
